Version 1.3.3: 2015-07-17

	- explicitly import functions from standard packages
	

Version 1.3.2: 2012-01-30

	- commented out unused code in 'RngStreams' library
          (in particular all printf() and exit() statements)


Version 1.3.1: 2011-05-10

	- fixed warning in Rd file

	- there is a small change that chi2 goodness-of-fit tests in
          directory 'tests' fail. As the seed is set at random this
          may occasionaly cause an ERROR when checking the package.
	  This event has been made even more unlikely (while real
          programming errors on new platforms should be detected).


Version 1.3.0: 2011-02-10

	- fixed bug: when rstream.RNG(s) was called with an 'rstream'
          object of class "rstream.mrg32k3a" two of more times
          consecutively, then the first element of the second the
          generated stream was discarded.
	  This has been fixed.

	  WARNING:
	  This fix may influence the sequence of generated random
	  numbers when a generator of class "rstream.mrg32k3a"
	  is set as global generator by means of rstream.RNG().
	  If reproducibility of prior results is important then add
	  the following statement to your code to revert to the old
	  behavior:

	     library(rstream)
	     rstream.version("1.2")

	- added paper in doc directory:
            P. L'Ecuyer and J. Leydold: 'rstream': Streams of Random
            Numbers for Stochastic Simulation.
	    R News 5/2, 16-20, 2005.

	- updated authors email address


Version 1.2.5: 2010-05-05

	- fixed bug: loading a packaged rstream object from 
          an .RData file did not work unless another new 
          rstream object was created.


Version 1.2.4: 2009-11-17

	- fixed syntax of some Rd files


Version 1.2.3: 2009-01-08

	- changed copyright notice in file 'RngStreams.c'
          to avoid ambiguity about license (GPL)


Version 1.2.2: 2007-09-10

	- added method 'show' (just calls 'print')

	- Bug fixes:
	    . added protector for external pointer
            . avoid nonessential compiler warning with R version 2.6.0


Version 1.2.1: 2006-09-21

	- Fixed DESCRIPTION file for upcoming R-2.4.0 release


Version 1.2: 2006-02-15

	- Fixed signature of method rstream.sample
	  (the old one does not work with R Version >=2.3.0)


Version 1.1: 2005-10-01

	- Added class "rstream.mrg32k3a" to replace "rstream.lecuyer"
          (suggested by Pierre L'Ecuyer)


Version 1.0: 2005-04-02

        - First public release.
